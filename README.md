Project Description: We have made an application named Bulk SMS. Through this application one can send messages to all the members of a selected group. The group can be created by selected contacts and CSV file can also be added to the list. We have made another feature of creating message templates where some commonly used messages can be saved. One can edit the templates and also can create new templates according to the necessity. The messages will be sent to all selected contacts by their individual names. When a CSV file is selected then individuals’ information which are stored in that file can also be accessed in the messages. It is also possible to send single message to a single person. One can see the names and numbers of group members in a group at the group bar, all the contacts saved in phone at contacts bar and all the created templates at templates bar. In the phone’s messages folder, the sent messages can be seen.

This application is user friendly. The source code and the whole project link is given below.
